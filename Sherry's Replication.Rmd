# 1. Introduction

This report presents a replication of selected analyses from the study *Skin temperature changes in wild chimpanzees upon hearing vocalizations of conspecifics* by Dezecache et al. (2017). The study used infrared thermography (IRT) to measure facial temperature changes in chimpanzees in response to different vocalizations. These changes are thought to reflect emotional or autonomic nervous system responses.

This replication focuses on three components: - Changes in nose and ear temperature before and after hearing a vocalization (**Figure 3**) - Temperature over time in response to **aversive vs. non-aversive calls** (**Figure 4**) - Temperature over time for specific call types (**Figure 5**)

# 2. Data Import and Inspection

```{r load-data}
figure3 <- read_csv("figure3.csv")
figure4 <- read_csv("figure4.csv")
figure5 <- read_csv("figure5.csv")
```

```{r}
head(figure3)
```

```{r}
# Calculate descriptive stats for Nose and Ear
descriptive_stats_fig3 <- figure3 %>%
  group_by(Type) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_before = round(mean(Before, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
    sd_before = round(sd(Before, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
    mean_after = round(mean(After, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
    sd_after = round(sd(After, na.rm = TRUE), 2)
  )

descriptive_stats_fig3
```

SECOND DESCRIPTIVE

```{r}
# --- Classify time periods as 'Before' and 'After'
figure4_descriptive_NEW <- figure4 %>%
  mutate(
    Period = ifelse(Time < 0, "Before", "After")
  )

# --- Calculate means and SDs for each Region x Condition x Period group
descriptive_stats_fig4_NEW <- figure4_descriptive_NEW %>%
  group_by(Type, Condition, Period) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_temp = round(mean(Temperature, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
    sd_temp = round(sd(Temperature, na.rm = TRUE), 2)
  ) %>%
  arrange(Type, Condition, Period)

descriptive_stats_fig4_NEW
```

STATE THE PROBLEM HERE

inferential

```{r}
# Perform paired t-tests for Nose and Ear
t_test_nose <- figure3 %>%
  filter(Type == "Nose") %>%
  with(t.test(Before, After, paired = TRUE))

t_test_ear <- figure3 %>%
  filter(Type == "Ear") %>%
  with(t.test(Before, After, paired = TRUE))

# Display results
t_test_nose
t_test_ear

```

Interpretation:

If your output for the nose region gives a t-statistic near 3.52 and a p-value \< 0.001, it confirms the significant decrease reported by the authors.

If the ear region test shows a t-statistic near âˆ’2.38 with p \< 0.05, it supports their finding of a significant increase in ear temperature.

These results demonstrate that your replication accurately captures the statistical effects originally reported, validating your data preparation and analysis pipeline.

pearson

```{r}
# Function to apply Pearson correlation per group
library(broom)

cor_results <- figure4 %>%
  group_by(Type, Condition) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    cor_test = list(cor.test(Time, Temperature, method = "pearson")),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    tidied = map(cor_test, broom::tidy)
  ) %>%
  unnest(tidied) %>%
  select(Type, Condition, n, estimate, p.value, statistic)

cor_results

```

it actually worked for the nose!!!

"The same patterns are visible when applying Pearson linear correlations between the two variables time and temperature (aversive: râ€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.29, nâ€‰=â€‰171, pâ€‰\<â€‰0.001; non-aversive: râ€‰=â€‰0.08, nâ€‰=â€‰50, pâ€‰=â€‰0.28)."

for figure 5

```{r}
# Perform Pearson correlations for each combination of Region and Vocalization
cor_results_fig5 <- figure5 %>%
  group_by(Region, Vocalization) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    cor_test = list(cor.test(Time, Temperature, method = "pearson")),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    tidied = map(cor_test, tidy)
  ) %>%
  unnest(tidied) %>%
  select(Region, Vocalization, n, estimate, p.value, statistic)

# View results
cor_results_fig5

```

works perfectly!!! yayyyy. enough data = precise and accurate replication

# 6. Conclusion

This replication broadly confirms the findings of Dezecache et al. (2017): - Nose temperature tends to **decrease** after vocalizations, while ear temperature tends to **increase**. - Aversive vocalizations show a more pronounced temperature shift compared to non-aversive ones. - Distinct vocalizations are associated with different thermal profiles, particularly in the nose.

### Notes:

Some differences may arise from how missing data were handled, data cleaning, or potential nuances in the original figure construction. This replication demonstrates strong alignment with the original analyses.
